A Serverless Ride-Sharing App on AWS 
Project Plan Title: Crazy Rides: A Serverless Ride-Sharing  App on AWS. 
Team Members and Roles: 
Vinay Viswanadh Alli (16359315) – Project Lead, Frontend Developer 
Shivanjali Dyapa (16359877) – Backend Developer, Lambda + API Gateway 
Hyma Reddy Undela (16370604) – AWS Infrastructure Setup, Cognito, and     
IAM      
Motivation/Purpose: 
This project recreates AWS’s “Crazy Rydes” sample app to demonstrate building 
a full-stack, serverless web application. It covers key features like user 
authentication, backend processing, and real-time database interaction. 
It also includes CI/CD deployment, making development and updates easier. By 
using AWS services, the app runs efficiently without needing to manage servers. 
The goal is to gain hands-on experience with AWS while building a real-world 
serverless app. This helps in understanding how to manage users, automate 
backend tasks, and store data in the cloud. 
Utilized Cloud Tech:  
"Crazy Rides" is a unicorn-themed ride-hailing app where registered users can 
request a magical ride. It showcases a fully serverless web development approach 
using AWS, covering everything from code deployment and authentication to 
backend processing and data storage. 
AWS Services Used: 
• AWS Amplify – CI/CD hosting for the React-based frontend 
• Amazon Cognito – Manages user authentication and access control 
• AWS Lambda – Handles ride requests with serverless backend logic 
• Amazon DynamoDB – NoSQL database for storing ride request data 
• Amazon API Gateway – Connects Lambda functions via a RESTful API 
• IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Manages roles and permissions 
for secure access 
• GitHub – Version control and CI/CD integration with Amplify
